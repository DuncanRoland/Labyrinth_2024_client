# Programming project web project group [XX]

## Before you start
* Go to file `sonar-project.properties` and replace "XX" with your **group number**.

## Instructions for local CI testing
You can **run** the validator and Sonar with CSS and JS rules **locally.** There is no need to push to the server to check if you are compliant with our rules. In the interest of sparing the server, please result to local testing as often as possible.

If everyone will push to test, the remote server will not last.

Please consult the Sonar guide at [https://gitlab.ti.howest.be/ti/2023-2024/s2/programming-project/documentation/documentation/-/blob/main/sonar-guide/Sonar%20guide.md](https://gitlab.ti.howest.be/ti/2023-2024/s2/programming-project/documentation/documentation/-/blob/main/sonar-guide/Sonar%20guide.md)

## Client
In order to help you along with planning, we've provided a client roadmap
[https://gitlab.ti.howest.be/ti/2023-2024/s2/programming-project/documentation/documentation/-/blob/main/roadmaps/client-roadmap.md?ref_type=heads](https://gitlab.ti.howest.be/ti/2023-2024/s2/programming-project/documentation/documentation/-/blob/main/roadmaps/client-roadmap.md?ref_type=heads)

## File structure
All files should be placed in the `src` directory.

**Do not** change the file structure of the folders outside of that directory. Within, you may do as you please.

## API URL
[https://project-1.ti.howest.be/2023-2024/labyrinth/api/](https://project-1.ti.howest.be/2023-2024/labyrinth/api/)

## Default files

### CSS
The `reset.css` has aleady been supplied, but it's up to you and your team to add the rest of the styles. Please feel free to split those up in multiple files. We'll handle efficient delivery for products in production in later semesters.

### JavaScript
A demonstration for connecting with the API has already been set up. We urge you to separate your JS files as **atomically as possible**. Add folders as you please. Make use of javascript modules (as seen in the Web Development Essentials classes).
